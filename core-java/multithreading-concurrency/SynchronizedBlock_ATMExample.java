Expected Output (order of users may vary, but transactions won't overlap):

Alice entered the ATM area.
Bob entered the ATM area.
Charlie entered the ATM area.
Alice is using the ATM...
Alice completed the transaction.
Alice left the ATM.

Bob is using the ATM...
Bob completed the transaction.
Bob left the ATM.

Charlie is using the ATM...
Charlie completed the transaction.
Charlie left the ATM.
